# Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to learn Python from its basics. Also, 
helping other people to start programming in Python. 
Currently, I'm an intermediate user of Python who wants to learn more,
so the difficulty of the codes will be slightly increased over time 
(and also, I hope, the fun of the creations).

# How to run the code

In order to run the different codes, we can use a code editor or,
if we want simply to use the command prompt, write:

python file.py

Substituting "file" by the name of the file we want to run.
